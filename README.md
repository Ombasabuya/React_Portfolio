## User Story

As a new React developer, I have recently graduated from Software Engineering Online - Moringa School, and I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with technical teams in building single-page applications. I am passionate about React development and eager to contribute to meaningful projects. Additionally, I am open to receiving feedback and reviews on my React code and portfolio as I aim to continuously improve and showcase my skills as a potential developer.

## Project Goal

* The goal of this project is to create a single-page application portfolio for a web developer that fulfills the following acceptance criteria:

* When the portfolio is loaded, it should display a header, a content section, and a footer.
* The header should contain the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
* The navigation titles should include "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume." The currently selected section should be highlighted.
* Clicking on a navigation title should display the corresponding section below the navigation without reloading the page, and the clicked title should be highlighted.
* When the portfolio is loaded for the first time, the default selected section should be "About Me."
In the "About Me" section, there should be a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a brief bio about them.
* The "Portfolio" section should display titled images of six applications developed by the developer, with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
* The "Contact" section should include a contact form with fields for name, email address, and message.
* If a user moves the cursor out of a form field without entering text, a notification should appear indicating that the field is required.
* When entering text in the email address field, a notification should be displayed if an invalid email address is entered.
* The "Resume" section should provide a link to download the developer's resume and a list of their proficiencies.
* The footer should include text or icon links to the developer's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as their profile on a third platform (such as Stack Overflow or Twitter).
* By fulfilling these acceptance criteria, the project will deliver a fully functional single-page portfolio application for the web developer.
